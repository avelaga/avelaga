Hi! I'm a full time software developer and Computer Science graduate of The University of Texas at Austin. I love software development, design, and art and enjoy finding ways to intersect my passions with creative tools such as Raspberry PI, Arduino, and Processing. 

Visit my [my website](https://abhi.work) to see more of my work and for more details about my technical skills, check out my [resume](https://abhi.work/1aa7ad4c5935a9bf76bb4cac9ab8affe.pdf) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhivelaga/).

I also document useful techniques that I've developed or learned [here](https://github.com/avelaga?tab=repositories&q=demo&type=&language=&sort=).
