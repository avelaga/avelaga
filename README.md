I'm a Computer Science undergraduate at The University of Texas at Austin. I love software development and design and am working towards becoming a full time front end developer. I also study fine arts as a minor and enjoy finding ways to intersect the two passions with creative tools such as Raspberry PI, Arduino, and Processing.This is a collection of my programming and web related projects.
